# MentalMATH

## What is it?
**MentalMATH** was inspired by my girlfriend to help her and others with their mental math skills. In a primarily technology based world we don't need to rely on 
our mental ability to do math, we all have calculators in our pockets. Nevertheless, the brain is just like any other muscle and needs to be worked out 
every now and then, which is where this app comes in. So go ahead and work it! Head over to <a href="https://alexeimowat.github.io/mental-math/">the app</a> and 
see how high you can get your streak!

## Features
**MentalMATH** offers the ability to practice mental math in 3 main modes:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Subtraction

Each of these modes has 3 difficulty levels, **easy**, **medium**, or **hard** which simply changes the ranges of the numbers that can appear for any given expression.

Below is a sample addition expression with the difficulty options:

The app also provides a streak tracker and an overall best score for any given session. As you progress and get answers correct the streak increases, and if you
manage to surpase your top score it will be updated in real time.

The streak and top score will remain if you decide to choose a different diffulty for that given mode, but it will be reset if you choose a different mode.
Maintaining these scores is planned for future updates.

## Technology
This app is a static application and was built using the following tech:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Vue 3
- NodeJs

The motivation for these choices was primarily to practice and play around with Vue as a new framework to me. Based on the project scope and idea I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to try a new framework that I've not used before to expand my knowledge and experience. 

## Moving forward
In the current state, the app meets my target user's demands which is why it is posted on GitHub pages. 

However, I do have many more features that I want to implement which will be adding to the backlog. A few ideas are:
- Including a database. Having the ability to store previous highscores would make the app feel more like a goal to keep improving ones score
- Adding simple user accounts. This would tie nicely to the above point as a user would be able to track their progress separately from other users
- Implementing a timed round where a user has a certain amount of time to solve a problem
- Adding a division mode
- Adding a percent mode, for tips, discounts, and other real work scenarios
- Including tips and images (times tables) to help users learn how to solve problems or improve their skills
- Add a skip button to generate new expressions
- Create more complex expressions, for example having expressions with 3 numbers to add, or a mix of both to practice order of operations

## Final Remarks
Thank you for taking the time to look at my app ðŸ™‚. I had a lot of fun learning new skills and building 
something from scratch for someone to enjoy using, which made this project something I can be proud of. 
Feel free to browse the source code, clone the project, or reach out for any questions.
